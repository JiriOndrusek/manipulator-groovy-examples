Introduction
============

This is a demonstration Maven based project to create Groovy scripts for either
[PME](https://github.com/release-engineering/pom-manipulation-ext) or [GME](https://github.com/project-ncl/gradle-manipulator).
It is setup to make development easier within an IDE (primarily for IntelliJ but should work in other environments).

Prerequisites
=============

IntelliJ
--------

To ensure the [GMavenPlus](https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/) plugin correctly works within
IntelliJ it is advised that the following plugin is installed first:

* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7442-gmavenplus-intellij-plugin


Usage
=====

Currently this project comes with two sample groovy scripts ( with API completion enabled ) and two
sample tests to demonstrate the application of those scripts.
